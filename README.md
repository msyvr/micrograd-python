Implementing [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)

Reimplementing this as a warm up to implementing in Rust!

To experiment with a very simple binary classifier model that has randomly generated inputs and targets:
```bash
python train.py
```
Parameters for step size, number of epochs, activation function, etc., can be updated in `train.py` to see the effects of each on model convergence to targets.
